# Membership Inference Attacks
Python package to create adversarial agents for membership inference attacks againts machine learning models.

Implementation of the work done by Shokri _et al_: [paper](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~shmat/shmat_oak17.pdf)

## TO DO
* Basic package outline
* Shadow Model and Attack Model
* Shadow dataset generator using the data synthesis algorithm proposeb by Shokri _et al_
* Dummy example with Iris dataset
* Expand functionality and generalization of the package
